## 22/12/2019
### What have I done?
Cleaned up the repo with bfg (removed the framework and it should be smaller now). Added `PlayerAccount` and `GameServer`. 
### What to do tomorrow?
I feel like there are still some issues with the current model. How to update local data? You don't need to update wiki data unless there is an update. All you need to do it to diff new data with old data and display it. However, how about preference? The user could update it anytime. How about putting it inside the provider? I still don't know...

## 21/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Cacheable` now has two children, `Preference` and `CachedWiki`. 
### What to do tomorrow?
More models.

## 20/12/2019
### What have I done?
Some more designs on OneNote
### What to do tomorrow?
Actually write some codes and see if it works.

## 19/12/2019
### What have I done?
Updated folder structure and lots of refactoring have been done. 
Many new issues have been discovered and I am starting to write more downloaders and models. 
That's a lot of work to do but it is good this way. Do it slowly and don't rush. 
### What to do tomorrow?
Write some `APIDownloader` and maybe more updates on folder structure.

## 15/12/2019
### What have I done?
Meeting with senpai and some decisions were made. `Home` is now updated and `Loading` is added.
### What to do tomorrow?
More loading and maybe test update theme.

## 14/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Settings` has been updated to show a section list but is it really a good idea? 
`AppLogo` now takes a `size` and version number is added as well. 
### What to do tomorrow?
First meeting with senpai and some dicussions on some topics.

## 06/12/2019
### What have I done?
`Setup` has been added but it only has 3 titles now without any functionalities. Privacy policy & term of use were added (template only) but three languages are too much... 
I have to work harder maybe with my senpai! If I can deal with data correctly, the rest is just copy and paste my old code which shouldn't be really hard.
### What to do tomorrow?
More models, API and DataManager.

## 04/12/2019
### What have I done?
`BasicDownloader` and `APIResponse`. There will be lots of classes but this is the only to make sure it is safe. Therefore, I have to write lots of code for this... but it is good in the long run.
### What to do tomorrow?
Add more models.

## 02/12/2019
### What have I done?
Updated to `1.0.7/1.6.6` to fix some bugs and tabs were added to log files.
### What to do tomorrow?
Same as below, `DataManager`.

## 29/11/2019
### What have I done?
Mac OS on Surface with the help of [this repo](https://github.com/hacker1024/Hackintosh-Clover-SurfacePro3). It works really well and I am quite happy with it. `BottomButton` was created but it is kinda limited now. Some components were moved to `common/` folder. `Welcome` is done I think and for `Agreement`, I have added two button at the bottom. If the user declines, he/she will either go back to home or simply dismiss the alert.
### What to do tomorrow?
My exams is next Monday so I think I will do some serious study. The issue now is that I am still not clear on what I need to do for `DataManager`. However, don't need to rush. I will reuse many codes from the old project (not really) so it should be fine.
