### What have I done?
Mac OS on Surface with the help of [this repo](https://github.com/hacker1024/Hackintosh-Clover-SurfacePro3). It works really well and I am quite happy with it. `BottomButton` was created but it is kinda limited now. Some components were moved to `common/` folder. `Welcome` is done I think and for `Agreement`, I have added two button at the bottom. If the user declines, he/she will either go back to home or simply dismiss the alert.
### What to do tomorrow?
My exams is next Monday so I think I will do some serious study. The issue now is that I am still not clear on what I need to do for `DataStorage`. However, don't need to rush. I will reuse many codes from the old project (not really) so it should be fine.
