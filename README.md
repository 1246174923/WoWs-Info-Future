# WoWs Info
This is an unofficial app for the game [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com/). Its predecessor is [WoWs Info Swift](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Swift) but it is only available on IOS. This project aims to build a cross platform version of WoWs Info for IOS, Android and Windows 10. I learnt a lot from [GoGoAnime App](https://github.com/HenryQuan/React-Native-GoGoAnime) and I believe React Native could be the right choice for me (good for small projects)
