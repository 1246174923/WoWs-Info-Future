Laid down as ocean raiders, cruisers Châteaurenault and Guichen were too expensive, and poorly armed. It was decided to consider and fix these drawbacks when building the third ship.\nIn November 1897, a cruiser named after the naval commander, historian, and member of the French Academy – Admiral Jean Pierre Edmond Jurien de La Gravière – was laid down at the naval shipyard in Lorient. The new ship was smaller than her predecessors, but she was almost as fast. She also had much better armament, with eight 165 mm guns in comparison to the two 165 mm and six 139 mm carried by Châteaurenault and Guichen. Extended trials delayed her commissioning, and, as a result, Jurien de la Gravière was completed only in 1903.

The U.S. Navy was booming at that time, and in heavy pursuit of the ocean's glory. Steel monsters under the star-spangled banner had to demonstrate that they were in no way inferior to representatives of the maritime powers of the Old World.

The gun was nicknamed the pom-pom because of the characteristic sound it produced when firing. Mark II guns were almost solely produced as single-mounts with manual aiming. Some of the initial pom-pom guns would also be used during World War II, mostly on mobilized civil vessels.\n\nThe early 1920s saw the start of development of a 40 mm multi-barreled AA gun with a power drive. Due to poor funding, typical of the British Admiralty in the 1920s, the process of accepting the new gun into service was a very long one. Only in the early 1930s did the navy start to receive the first 40 mm AA Mark VIII guns, initially placed in octuple mounts. The new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the shell weighing a little over 900 grams. The pom-pom gun was inferior in terms of almost all performance characteristics in comparison to Bofors AA automatic guns of the same caliber.

Laid down just before the outbreak of World War II, the ship started her wartime career in the middle of 1942.\n\nIn December 1943, HMS Jamaica served as part of the force lead by battleship Duke of York. In the Battle of the North Cape, the cruiser kept pace with her flagship, scored a hit with her first salvo, and maintained an unprecedented rate of fire. The total number of 152 mm shells fired by Jamaica reached 461, which exceeded the efficiency of any other British cruiser that participated in that battle. In the final stage of the battle, Jamaica managed to launch torpedoes from both of her torpedo tubes and scored one or two hits.","name":"Cruiser Jamaica","card_id":4172192688},"4181629872":{"images":{"small":"https://glossary-wows-global.gcdn.co/icons//collections/card_icons/small/PCZC108_NY2018_HMSDuke_of_york_gk356_bc49ed2b97ce08e64c82bec1e49c85631d2f8c508d453a166c6e89477c7983ab.png"},"collection_id":4288650160,"description":"Throughout the history of shipbuilding, quadruple turrets were rarely seriously considered for the main armament due to the complexity of their design. Instances of their embodiment in metal were more of an exception to the rule. One such exception were the King George V-class battleships to which HMS Duke of York belonged. Each of the ships carried ten 14-inch (356 mm) Mk.VII guns, which were mounted in one Mk.II twin turret and two Mk.III quadruple turrets.\n\nKing George V-class battleships couldn't boast the largest caliber of guns, and her guns had a lot of mechanical internals which didn't always work reliably, but under combat conditions the ships' main guns proved highly accurate and quite destructive. During the Battle of the North Cape, Duke of York scored a hit on the first salvo, disabling Scharnhorst's foremost turrets. During the first two hours of the battle, the German battleship lost all of her combat capability after taking hits from Duke of York's main guns, whereas the British ship sustained no significant damage from Scharnhorst's counterfire.","name":"Main Battery Turret of Battleship Duke of York","card_id":4181629872},"4192115632":{"images":{"small":"https://glossary-wows-global.gcdn.co/icons//collections/card_icons/small/PCZC098_Wows_GermDestr_47eb3036cbbe10d74cbcdb2c64778fe119c98583ff25df115c7e5f76b6449182.png"},"collection_id":4289698736,"description":"\"Why the heck do we need all those destroyers with third-rate concealment and short-range torps?\" our players used to ask. \"To search for enemy ships with their hydroacoustics; to torp and surprise them with their armor-piercing shells,\" developers replied.

It's been a bumpy ride, but we're finally getting into smoother waters.\n\nSince that time it's been considered good etiquette to object in a friendly manner in any communication with developers by saying something like \"Hey, you don't wanna mess things up like you did with the German destroyers, right?\"","name":"Hunting the Hunters","card_id":4192115632},"4212038576":{"images":{"small":"https://glossary-wows-global.gcdn.co/icons//collections/card_icons/small/PCZC079_Yamamoto_Kaga_0ff1ed3e34025aee6dbdbff9e80af3d6086d2d1da885ad68d9540daba8c6d624.png"},"collection_id":4290747312,"description":"The Great Kantō earthquake caused the destruction of the battlecruiser Amagi that was supposed to be completed as an aircraft carrier.
